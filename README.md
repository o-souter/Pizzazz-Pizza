# Pizzazz Pizza
Java UI design project for Advanced Software Design and Development (cm2100), Robert Gordon University

This Program uses Java and JavaFX to display a user interface a Pizza shop could use. It allows the user to create an order with different items, and create pizzas to order.

## Functionality

Using the Pizzazz Pizza Java Program, a user can:
* View existing orders
* Create new orders
* View order information such as price, items and name of order
* View existing menu items
* View existing pizza toppings
* Create unique pizzas and toppings - which can then be added to an order and are saved
